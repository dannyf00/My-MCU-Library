# My-MCU-Library
My library of code that works on various MCUs, to promote code re-usability and portability

Here is a set of routines that I often use in my personal projects on MCUs. The goal is to write code that can be used with no change, or little change, over a wide spectrum of devices.

They are published here for your personal use as well.
